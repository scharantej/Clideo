 ## Problem Analysis

Building a video editing website involves creating a platform that allows users to upload, edit, and share videos. The website should provide users with a range of editing tools, such as trimming, cropping, adding effects, and adjusting audio levels. Additionally, the website should provide users with the ability to share their videos on social media platforms or download them to their devices.

## Design

The design for a Flask application to build a video editing website should include the following HTML files:

* `index.html`: This file will serve as the homepage of the website and will provide users with a way to upload videos, access the video editor, and view their edited videos.
* `video-editor.html`: This file will contain the video editor and will allow users to edit their videos using the provided tools.
* `videos.html`: This file will display a list of all the videos that the user has uploaded and will allow them to edit or delete videos.
* `shared-videos.html`: This file will display a list of all the videos that the user has shared on social media platforms.
* `downloaded-videos.html`: This file will display a list of all the videos that the user has downloaded to their device.

The following routes should be included in the Flask application:

* `/`: This route will render the `index.html` file.
* `/video-editor`: This route will render the `video-editor.html` file.
* `/videos`: This route will render the `videos.html` file.
* `/shared-videos`: This route will render the `shared-videos.html` file.
* `/downloaded-videos`: This route will render the `downloaded-videos.html` file.
* `/upload-video`: This route will handle the uploading of videos to the website.
* `/edit-video`: This route will handle the editing of videos.
* `/share-video`: This route will handle the sharing of videos on social media platforms.
* `/download-video`: This route will handle the downloading of videos to the user's device.

## Implementation

The implementation of the Flask application will involve creating the HTML files and routes described above, as well as writing the Python code to handle the uploading, editing, and sharing of videos. The application will need to be hosted on a web server in order to be accessible to users.
